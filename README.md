FacebookPublicPostSearch
========================

These classes allow to search for public posts on Facebook according to specific queries which can be simple (e.g. "football")
or composed (e.g. "football,soccer").

They can be used as "almost streaming" method by being runned infinitely (see test2 example).

Enjoy !

UPDATE : Version 2.0 (or later) of the Graph API does not let you search for posts anymore. You can continue to search for post by adding v1.0/ after https://graph.facebook.com/. Nevertheless, make sure that your app was registered before 30th April 2014 to be able to use with v1.0
